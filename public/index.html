    <h1>We have a /hello folder and a /hello.html file</h1>
    <p>
      When deployed on Netlify, visiting /hello correctly displays the page.
      In netlify dev, visiting /hello results in 403 Forbidden because the
      server routes the request to the /hello folder and viewing directories is
      disabled.
